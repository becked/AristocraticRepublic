<p>Power shared is power contested. Every 10 turns, elevate a new family head to the throne — or keep your current leader, if the other families will allow it.</p>

<h2>Rules</h2>
<ul>
<li>Elections occur every 10 turns starting at turn 10</li>
<li>Candidates are family heads who are adult, healthy, and not the current leader</li>
<li>Each candidate must come from a different family</li>
<li>The current leader may run for re-election, but only if all families have at least Cautious opinion</li>
<li>The winning candidate's family gains +20 opinion for 20 turns</li>
<li>All other families lose 20 opinion for 20 turns</li>
<li>New leaders receive a legitimacy bonus that scales with game progress: small in the early game, large in the late game</li>
<li>Re-elected leaders receive a smaller legitimacy bonus than new leaders</li>
<li>Leader changes use the Seize Throne mechanism, so there are no heir-bypass penalties</li>
</ul>
