<p>Power shared is power contested. Every 10 turns, elevate a new family head to the throne — or keep your current leader, if the other families will allow it.</p>

<h2>Difficulty</h2>
<ul>
<li><b>Stable</b> (default): Re-election requires Cautious+ opinion from all families. +8 legitimacy per election.</li>
<li><b>Strained</b>: Re-election requires Pleased+ opinion. +6 legitimacy per election.</li>
<li><b>Fragile</b>: Re-election requires Friendly+ opinion. +4 legitimacy per election.</li>
</ul>
<p>Enable Strained or Fragile in game setup under Rules.</p>

<h2>Rules</h2>
<ul>
<li>Elections occur every 10 turns starting at turn 10</li>
<li>Candidates are family heads who are adult, healthy, and not the current leader</li>
<li>Each candidate must come from a different family</li>
<li>The current leader may run for re-election, but only if all families meet the opinion threshold</li>
<li>The winning candidate's family gains +20 opinion for 20 turns</li>
<li>All other families lose 20 opinion for 20 turns</li>
<li>Leader changes use the Seize Throne mechanism, so there are no heir-bypass penalties</li>
</ul>
