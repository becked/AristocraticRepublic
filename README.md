# Aristocratic Republic

![Aristocratic Republic](logo-512.png)

An Old World mod that replaces dynastic succession with an aristocratic republic. Every 10 turns, elevate a new family head to the throne — or keep your current leader, if the other families will allow it.

## Features

- Elections every 10 turns with 1-3 candidates from different families
- No dynastic heir — the heir slot stays empty between elections
- No heir-bypass murders, coups, or exile events
- No coronation or succession events after elections
- Emergency elections if the leader dies mid-term
- Vanilla succession laws locked while elective is active
- Three difficulty presets with different re-election thresholds

## Difficulty Presets

| Preset | Re-election Threshold | Legitimacy |
|--------|----------------------|-----------|
| **Stable** (default) | Cautious+ | +8 |
| **Strained** | Pleased+ | +6 |
| **Fragile** | Friendly+ | +4 |

Enable Strained or Fragile in game setup under Rules. Leave both off for Stable.

## Rules

- Elections occur every 10 turns starting at turn 10
- Candidates are family heads who are adult, healthy, and not the current leader
- Each candidate must come from a different family
- The current leader may run for re-election, but only if all families meet the opinion threshold
- The winning candidate's family gains +20 opinion for 20 turns
- All other families lose 20 opinion for 20 turns
- Leader changes use the Seize Throne mechanism, so there are no heir-bypass penalties
