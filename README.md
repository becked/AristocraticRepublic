# Aristocratic Republic

![Aristocratic Republic](logo-512.png)

An Old World mod that adds a republic government system with periodic elections every 10 turns.

Power shared is power contested. Every 10 turns, elevate a new family head to the throne — or keep your current leader, if the other families will allow it.

## Difficulty Presets

| Preset | Re-election Threshold | Legitimacy |
|--------|----------------------|-----------|
| **Stable** (default) | Cautious+ | +8 |
| **Strained** | Pleased+ | +6 |
| **Fragile** | Friendly+ | +4 |

Enable Strained or Fragile in game setup under Rules. Leave both off for Stable.

## Rules

- Elections occur every 10 turns starting at turn 10
- Candidates are family heads who are adult, healthy, and not the current leader
- Each candidate must come from a different family
- The current leader may run for re-election, but only if all families meet the opinion threshold
- The winning candidate's family gains +20 opinion for 20 turns
- All other families lose 20 opinion for 20 turns
- Leader changes use the Seize Throne mechanism, so there are no heir-bypass penalties
