  <displayName>Aristocratic Republic</displayName>
  <description>Power shared is power contested. Every 10 turns, elevate a new family head to the throne — or keep your current leader, if the other families will allow it.

Difficulty Levels:
- Stable (default): Re-election requires Cautious+ opinion from all families. +8 legitimacy per election.
- Strained: Re-election requires Pleased+ opinion. +6 legitimacy per election.
- Fragile: Re-election requires Friendly+ opinion. +4 legitimacy per election.
Enable Strained or Fragile in game setup under Rules.

Rules:
- Elections occur every 10 turns starting at turn 10
- Candidates are family heads who are adult, healthy, and not the current leader
- Each candidate must come from a different family
- The current leader may run for re-election, but only if all families meet the opinion threshold
- The winning candidate's family gains +20 opinion for 20 turns
- All other families lose 20 opinion for 20 turns
